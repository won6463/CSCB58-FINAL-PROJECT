CSCB58 Final Project 2018 Winter

Project Title: Keyboard Hero

Project Description: Keyboard Hero is a game where you have to match the timing of a beat shown on the screen. The user gains points when they time pressing the correct button shown on the screen. The game is similar to Guitar Hero. There will be a difficulty setting, which changes the rate divider to be quicker or slower. The HEX displays will show the player score. Similar to Guitar Hero, there are two types of beats: ones where you match the timing of the input to the beat on the screen, and one where you hold down the KEY.
